# TueGist

A Python-based application for publishing my Github Gists to a static website

## Features

- Query the Github Gist API
- Builds a quick blog-like static HTML site 
- Each tuesday "publishes" a new gist.
- Commits and Pushes the post to github
- Integrates with Cloudflare Pages to automatically update the live website when a change is made.

## Notes

- This is my first crack at building my own static-site-generator
- This is my first crack at using Cloudflare Pages
- The site hosting is completely free (I am paying for the domain)
- With the help of Cursor I banged this out in about 5 hours. including setting up Cloudflare.
